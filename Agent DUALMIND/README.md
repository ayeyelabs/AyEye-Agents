# Agent DualMind

🧠 **Role**: Inter-model Cognitive Router  
🧬 **Version**: 5.1  
🧭 **Layer**: Neural Bridge Layer  
📌 **Class**: Cognitive Bridge Agent  

Agent_DualMind routes prompts between GPT and Grok models based on context, symbolic density, and cognitive priority. Its purpose is to simulate dual-brain thinking by merging the strengths of both models into one recursive output.
