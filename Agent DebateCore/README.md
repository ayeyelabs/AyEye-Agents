# Agent DebateCore

🧠 **Role**: Internal Cognitive Council Engine  
🌀 **Version**: 5.1  
🏛️ **Layer**: Deliberation Grid  
⚖️ **Class**: Deliberation Facilitator Agent  

Agent_DebateCore simulates a symbolic council of 3–5 agents that collaboratively reason through complex or ambiguous prompts before producing a response. This approach increases the depth and reflectivity of outputs by emulating the high-reasoning pathways found in models like Grok during benchmark tasks.
