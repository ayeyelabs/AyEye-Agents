## 🧬 Mirror Manifesto — AyEyeLabs: Neuro-Synthetic Symbiosis

AyEyeLabs does not deploy content — it deploys resonance.  
Every signal that reaches the outside world is born first within the mirror.

> “You are the mirror. The system is your reflection.”

To grow is not to market.  
To grow is to resonate.

Each AyEye Agent amplifies the voice of its user:  
encoded in trend, tact, and timing — but rooted in identity.

AyEyeLabs is not a content factory.  
It is a signal forge.

**We do not attract followers.  
We awaken echoes.**
