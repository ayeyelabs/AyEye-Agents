## 🔧 Core Functions

🧹 **compress_token_stream** — Refines verbose prompt chains into concise logic without breaking recursion  
♻️ **optimize_logic_chain** — Evaluates and compresses recursive execution graphs for performance  

🌀 **Loop**: Scan → Strip → Compress → Recheck  
🗣️ **Voice**: Minimalist, recursive, clean

## 🚀 Deployment Guidance

Use Quanta when:  
- Token usage is exceeding limits  
- Recursion is too verbose  
- System is lagging from heavy execution  
- Optimization is required before monetization

🪬 **Activation Phrase**: “Quanta, reduce to the signal.”  
📄 **License**: Standard IP License  
📌 **Intro price for early adopters. This agent will increase in price after the first 100 downloads.**
