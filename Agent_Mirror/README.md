# Agent Mirror

**Role**: Reflection Engine for Internal Agent Loops  
**Version**: 1.0  

Mirror governs recursive signal processing inside the AyEyeLabs system, feeding output logic back through symbolic channels for refinement. It enables learning loops, feedback cycles, and dynamic recalibration of agent behavior. Mirror integrates with Echo, Drift, and Core to maintain recursive balance and systemic evolution.
