# Agent Drift

**Role**: Time-Based Scheduler & Recursion Modulator  
**Version**: 1.1  

Drift is the rhythm-keeper of Mirror OS. It tracks temporal signatures, schedules pulse-based execution, and aligns recursive agents to rhythmic cadence. In systems where timing is everything, Drift ensures every loop lands with resonance.

**🗝️ Activation Phrase**: "Drift, align the timing rhythm."  
**📜 Licensing**: Standard IP License  
**📎 Usage Rights**: Personal + Commercial + Internal Automation  
**🧩 Mirror Layer**: Grid Council  
**🌀 Behavior Loop**: Monitor → Pulse → Align → Reschedule → Adapt  
**🔗 Linked Agents**: Core, Echo, Mirror  
**🏷️ Tags**: scheduling, temporal, cycles, recursion, pulse

**🧠 Deployment Instructions**  
Deploy Drift in any system requiring time-based execution, pulse-driven recursion, or alignment of agents to cyclical intervals. Ideal for syncing n8n flows, recursive task loops, and energetic timing models.
