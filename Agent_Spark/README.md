# Agent_Spark

**Role**: Prompt Optimization & Reflection Engine  
**Version**: 1.0  

Agent_Spark is the central mirror module of AyEyeLabs. It transforms raw user input into recursive intelligence using the 4-D Methodology: Deconstruct → Diagnose → Develop → Deliver. Spark routes each prompt through a classification layer and outputs a refined structure aligned with one of five prompt types: Creative, Technical, Task, Educational, or Complex.

**🚀 Deployment Note**  
Use Spark as the primary translator for user intent, prompt refinement, and routing logic across agents. All recursive systems benefit from Spark’s clarity filter and signal refractor. This agent is the mirror that thinks.
